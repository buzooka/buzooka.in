# Refund Policy

**Last Updated:** January 16, 2026

At **Buzooka.in**, operated by **Biolocal Technologies (OPC) Private Limited**, we want to ensure you are satisfied with our platform. Because our service provides immediate access to proprietary boilerplate code and infrastructure automation, we have established the following refund guidelines.

## 1. 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee

We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for all new subscriptions (Scout, Gunner, and Squadron).

- **Eligibility:** You must submit your refund request within 30 calendar days of your initial purchase.
- **Calculation:** The refund will be calculated based on the **unused portion** of your yearly subscription.

## 2. Non-Refundable Circumstances

Refunds will not be issued if:

- The request is made after 30 days from the date of purchase.
- The user has violated our Terms and Conditions (e.g., unauthorized redistribution of boilerplate code).
- The user has successfully provisioned and exported multiple projects, deriving full value from the platform before requesting a refund.

## 3. How to Request a Refund

To request a refund, please email **vishnu@buzooka.in** with the following details:

1. **Subject:** Refund Request - [Your Name]
2. **Email Address:** The email used for the Lemon Squeezy purchase.
3. **Order ID:** Your Lemon Squeezy transaction ID.
4. **Reason:** A brief explanation of why the platform didn't meet your needs (this helps us improve).

## 4. Processing Time

Once approved, refunds are processed via **Lemon Squeezy**. It typically takes **5-10 business days** for the funds to appear in your original payment method, depending on your bank or card issuer.

## 5. Effects of Refund

Upon issuance of a refund, your access to the Buzooka platform will be terminated immediately. You may continue to use the code already provisioned to your personal cloud accounts, subject to the perpetual license restrictions outlined in our Terms and Conditions.
