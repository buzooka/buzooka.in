**Last Updated:** January 16, 2026

This Cookie Policy explains how **Biolocal Technologies (OPC) Private Limited** ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies when you visit **Buzooka.in**.

## 1. What are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain that placed the cookie. We use cookies to "remember" your session, understand how you interact with our platform, and improve your building experience.

## 2. Types of Cookies We Use

### A. Essential Cookies

These are strictly necessary for the platform to function. They enable core features such as:

- **Authentication:** Keeping you logged into your dashboard.
- **Security:** Preventing fraudulent use of login credentials.
- **Infrastructure Provisioning:** Maintaining state while the AI agents set up your MVP.

### B. Analytics and Performance Cookies

We use these to understand how builders use Buzooka. This helps us find bugs and improve the UI.

- **Google Analytics:** We use this to track page views and user flow.
- **Session Recording:** We may use tools (like Hotjar or similar) to see where users get stuck in the MVP generation process.

### C. Functional Cookies

These remember choices you make, such as your preferred cloud provider (AWS/Vercel) or theme settings, to provide a more personalized experience.

## 3. Third-Party Cookies

When you use Buzooka, third parties may also place cookies on your device:

- **Lemon Squeezy:** Our payment processor uses cookies to handle the checkout process and prevent fraud.
- **Cloud Providers:** If you link your GitHub or AWS accounts, those services may use cookies to manage the OAuth handshake.

## 4. How to Control Cookies

Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. You can:

- **Delete all cookies** from your browser.
- **Block all cookies** (Note: This will break the Buzooka dashboard functionality).
- **Opt-out of Analytics:** You can install the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
