# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 16, 2026

## 1. Introduction

**Biolocal Technologies (OPC) Private Limited** ("we") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we collect and handle your data at **Buzooka.in**.

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect the following information to provide our services:

- **Identity Data:** Name, email address, and profile picture.
- **Technical Credentials:** Secret keys and tokens (e.g., GitHub, AWS, Vercel) provided by you to enable auto-provisioning.
- **Payment Data:** Processed via Lemon Squeezy. We do not store full credit card details on our servers.

## 3. How We Use Your Data

Your data is used strictly to:

- Manage your account and subscriptions.
- Automate the deployment of code and infrastructure to your third-party accounts.
- Improve platform performance through analytics.

## 4. Third-Party Sharing

We share data with third parties only when necessary:

- **Merchant of Record:** Lemon Squeezy for secure payments.
- **AI Providers:** Small portions of logic may be processed via AI models (e.g., OpenAI) to generate your code.
- **Infrastructure Providers:** We pass credentials to your chosen providers (AWS, Vercel, etc.) to execute tasks on your behalf.

## 5. Data Security

We use industry-standard encryption to protect your secret keys. Because Buzooka does not host your final application, the data within your generated MVP remains entirely under your control and within your own cloud environment.

## 6. Cookies & Tracking

We use cookies and tracking tools (such as Google Analytics) to understand user behavior and maintain session states. You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings.

## 7. Your Rights (DPDP Act & GDPR)

Depending on your location, you have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. To exercise these rights or withdraw consent, please contact us at **vishnu@buzooka.in**.
