# Terms and Conditions

**Last Updated:** January 16, 2026

## 1. Agreement to Terms

By accessing or using **Buzooka.in** (the "Platform"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. These terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and **Biolocal Technologies (OPC) Private Limited** ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). If you do not agree with these terms, you are prohibited from using the service.

## 2. Services & Subscriptions

Buzooka provides a SaaS platform for generating MVPs, boilerplate code, and provisioning cloud infrastructure.

- **Plans:** We offer yearly subscription tiers (Scout, Gunner, Squadron).
- **Availability:** Services are provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. We do not guarantee 100% uptime as the platform relies on third-party cloud providers.

## 3. Payments & Merchant of Record

Payments are handled by **Lemon Squeezy**, our Merchant of Record.

- **Billing:** By subscribing, you agree to Lemon Squeezy’s terms.
- **Refunds:** We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for the **unused portion** of your subscription.
- **Cancellation:** You may cancel your subscription at any time. Cancellation prevents future billing but does not automatically delete code already provisioned to your personal accounts.

## 4. Intellectual Property & Licensing

- **Platform IP:** The Buzooka platform, AI agents, and automation logic remain the exclusive property of the Company.
- **Restricted Boilerplate License:** We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, perpetual, and non-transferable license to use the generated boilerplate code. This license is strictly limited to the **single project/application** generated for that specific instance on the Platform.
- **Restrictions:** You may not resell, redistribute, or use the boilerplate to create competing template products.
- **User Ownership:** You own the final "Output Content" (the unique application code and business logic) once it is provisioned to your accounts.

## 5. User Content & Third-Party Accounts

To use the Platform, you must provide certain PII and secret keys (e.g., AWS, GitHub). You represent that you have the legal right to provide these credentials. We use these only to automate your infrastructure and do not host your final MVP.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by Indian law, our total liability for any claim arising from your use of the service is limited to the **amount of the unused subscription fee** paid by you. We are not liable for failures in your cloud infrastructure or third-party service interruptions.

## 7. Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of **India**. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in **Ernakulam, Kerala**.
